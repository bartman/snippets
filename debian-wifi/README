Here is how I detect my wireless networks on Debian.

When I run ifup wlan0, etc/network/interfaces calls on which-wlan0.
This script receives networks I am interested in.  It looks at the
networks available and tries to find the match.  If it fails it selects
the strongest open network.

Example network/interfaces file is provided as an example.
