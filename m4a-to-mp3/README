This is my m4a to mp3 conversion script.
Long story: http://www.jukie.net/~bart/blog/m4a-to-mp3

You'll need to install: zsh faad id3v2 twolame toolame

The script calls 'lame' which may be called something else on your
system.  Edit the lame= definition at the top of the script, or make a
symlink.

To use it, just enter a directory with m4a files and run it to convert
everything, or specify a list of files to convert.
