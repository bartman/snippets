dedup is a script that removes duplicate .jpg and .nef files from the
directory in which it's ran.  The duplicates are moved to a "dups"
subdirectory, which is created.

It works by taking the md5sum of each file found, sorting the list by
md5sum, and then comparing each file with other files having the same
md5sum.  Any identical files will then be treated as duplicates.

I chose this algorithm as it was O(n).
