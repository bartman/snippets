  Uses the sieve of Eratosthenes.
  1. Start with a known prime (the base case is 2).  
  2. Step through all subsequent integers, marking off all multiples of
that prime.
  3. Find the next prime by searching for the first non-marked-off number
subsequent to the current prime.
  4.  Repeat.

  In the interest of saving space, the variable names are truncated.
Following is a description of the names.

r:  The [r]equested number of primes on the command line.
p:  The current [p]rime.
i:  [i]index into the area, used for Step 2, above.
c:  [c]ount of number of found primes, for comparison with r.
s:  [s]ize of the work space array.
t:  [t]emporary work space array.

  The Prime Number Theorem is used to approximate s.

  The indices of the array t represent the integers in the number line.
The values at those indices indicate:
  0 = Prime
  1 = Composite
